# PBQL Data Dictionary

<!-- GENERATED FILE — do not edit. Run `yarn docs` to regenerate

The complete queryable surface. Any property may be **unknown** when the
underlying data was not detected — see the unknown-handling rules in
[Language](language.md). `player.*` rows apply to every player
reference; positions are measured at the moment the current shot was hit.

## shot

The shot being tested. `shot[k]` addresses the shot k earlier/later in the same rally. `shot.hitter` navigates to the player who hit it.

| Property | Description | Type | Unit / values |
|---|---|---|---|
| `shot.hitter` | the player who hit this shot | player | |
| `shot.num` | which shot of the rally this is (the serve is 1) | number | 1-based |
| `shot.isFinal` | whether this is the rally's last shot | boolean |  |
| `shot.isVolley` | whether the ball was hit before bouncing | boolean |  |
| `shot.isSpeedup` | whether the shot added significant pace near the kitchen | boolean |  |
| `shot.isReset` | whether the shot was a volley that took significant pace off a hard incoming ball; only volleys are assessed | boolean |  |
| `shot.isPoach` | whether the hitter cut across in front of their partner to volley a ball that was headed to the partner | boolean |  |
| `shot.isPassing` | whether the shot was a rally-ending drive or smash that got past the nearest opponent untouched; unknown in singles | boolean |  |
| `shot.isPutaway` | whether the shot functioned as a putaway or rally finisher — a clean winner or a decisive attack that directly created the rally's end (can be a well-placed dink or drop, not only a hard hit) | boolean |  |
| `shot.type` | the shot classification; never set on serves and returns (shot.num 1 and 2) | string | "smash"\|"lob"\|"dink"\|"drop"\|"drive"\|"atp"\|"erne" |
| `shot.verticalType` | the vertical character of the stroke, from strike height (dig ≤ 2.5ft, overhead ≥ 6ft) | string | "dig"\|"neutral"\|"overhead" |
| `shot.strokeSide` | which side of the body the stroke was made on | string | "left"\|"right" |
| `shot.strokeType` | forehand or backhand, from strokeSide and the hitter's handedness; needs augmented insights carrying handedness (strokeSide always works) | string | "forehand"\|"backhand" |
| `shot.winnerType` | set only on a shot that WON the rally, and never on a fault: "clean" = the winning shot was fault-free, "forced_fault" = the OPPONENTS faulted replying to it. Both values mean the hitter won the rally. For faults the hitter committed use hasFault and errors.unforced instead; "forced_fault" here is not the opposite of errors.unforced, which describes the player who missed | string | "clean"\|"forced_fault" |
| `shot.quality.overall` | the overall quality of the shot, derived from the execution quality (1 is best) | number | 0-1 |
| `shot.quality.execution` | how well the shot was executed | number | 0-1 |
| `shot.quality.pressure` | positional pressure faced and imposed by this shot (1 = most pressure); unknown for singles, serves, and returns | number | 0-1 |
| `shot.positioningScore` | how well the hitter was positioned at this shot, against a strong-team baseline (1 is best); unknown for singles, serves, and returns | number | 0-1 |
| `shot.partnerPositioningScore` | how well the hitter's partner was positioned at this shot, against a strong-team baseline (1 is best); unknown for singles, serves, and returns | number | 0-1 |
| `shot.speed` | ball speed after the hit | number | mph |
| `shot.direction` | named direction the ball traveled, from the hitter's perspective (left/middle/right thirds of the court) | string | "DownTheMiddle"\|"DownTheLineLeft"\|"DownTheLineRight"\|"MidCrossLeft"\|"MidCrossRight"\|"LeftToMiddle"\|"RightToMiddle"\|"LeftCrossRight"\|"RightCrossLeft" |
| `shot.yaw` | horizontal launch angle (0 = toward the hitter's left sideline, 90 = straight at the net) | number | degrees |
| `shot.pitch` | vertical angle from the strike point up to the flight's peak (0 = flat or downward, 90 = straight up) | number | degrees |
| `shot.distance` | straight-line distance from where the ball was struck to where its flight ended | number | feet |
| `shot.distanceFromBaseline` | how far in front of the opponent's baseline the ball's flight ended (negative = past it) | number | feet |
| `shot.heightOverNet` | ball height when crossing the net plane | number | feet |
| `shot.crossedNet` | whether the ball crossed the plane of the net | boolean |  |
| `shot.confidence` | confidence in the reconstructed trajectory | number | 0-1 |
| `shot.hitTime` | when in the video the ball was struck | number | seconds |
| `shot.endTime` | when in the video the shot's flight ended | number | seconds |
| `shot.hasError` | whether any error was detected on this shot | boolean |  |
| `shot.errors.unforced` | whether the fault on this shot was an unforced error, i.e. the hitter MISSED without being put under pressure; only assessed on actual faults with a confidently-known rally winner. Not related to winnerType "forced_fault", which is set on a shot that WON | boolean |  |

| `shot.errors.faults.short` | whether the shot landed on the hitter's own side short of the net | boolean |  |
| `shot.errors.faults.out.outcome` | whether the out ball landed or was played anyway | string | "landed"\|"intercepted" |
| `shot.errors.faults.out.direction` | which way the ball went (or was headed) out — "long" past the baseline, "left"/"right" wide of a sideline from the hitter's perspective | string | "left"\|"right"\|"long" |

| `shot.isHitOnSide(side)` | whether the ball was struck on the given half ("left"\|"right") of the court in the hitter's frame (right = x >= 10) | boolean | |
| `shot.taggedWith(pattern)` | whether the hitter matches this name pattern (case-insensitive, * wildcard; untagged players match their default "Player N" name) or exact email | boolean | |
| `shot.inHighlight(kind)` | whether the shot falls inside a highlight of the given kind ("atp", "erne", "hands_battle" = a rapid volley exchange, "long_rally", "poach", "sequence" = a notable stretch of shots) | boolean | |
